Paddle tour of the Alster canals

- If you're not afraid of the water and would like to enjoy a really super day whilst at the same time doing a bit of upper body exercise, then why not pick up a paddle and work your way down the Alster canals in a canoe.
- Just go to any one of the countless boat and canoe hire points on the Alster to begin your adventure.
